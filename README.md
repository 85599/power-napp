# Purpose
This website was created to help you sleep better. It takes into account how long it takes the average human to fall asleep and then tells you when to wake up based on REM sleep cycles. We used HTML and CSS to create the animations that went into the background stars and the rotating moon. The time-based calculations were made using JavaScript. Check out our website at C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/powernapp-master/index.html  and happy sleeping! ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤


## Design
The background was created using CSS animations. Below is a static preview. The stars in the background twinkle and the moon rotates slowly over the course of two minutes. Click the link to Power Napp to see it in action!
